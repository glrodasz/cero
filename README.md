# RETO: Cero to Production
**Cero to production** is a project where we are building a productivity management application called "RETO" in a series of live coding sessions. The idea behind this sessions is to show all the complications and real thinking and decision making that common programmer do in daily basis with JavaScript.

The project is live streaming in [Twitch](https://glrz.me/stream).
